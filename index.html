                            Hi my name is Charlie. I am a developer in training at the UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp. I recieved my Bachelor's Degree in Geology from NC State in 2016 but after working in the industry for a few years, I realized my passion was elsewhere. I decided to pursue software developoment as a career because I have always loved technology, solving problems and creating things!

                            People knwo know me well would describe me as someone who loves adventure. I have always enjoyed outdoor activities and exploring new places. In the spring and fall, I go camping, mountain biking, sport shooting, and hiking. In the winter time I try to spend as much time snow skiing as possible because winter is my favorite season. In the summer I find myself out on the lake, water skiing and knee-boarding.
                    </p>

                    <p class="p-bio">
                            I have two rescue pets that I love very much. My cat Ary, who is a Himalayan Mounatin Cat mix and my dog Ranger, who is a mix between a dachshund and miniature pinscher.

                            Since you have read this far, I suppose I will give a few cool facts about myself. I am a certified SCUBA diver and have dove in the Florida Keys! I have also driven a Formula 4 racecar around Virginia International Raceway!
